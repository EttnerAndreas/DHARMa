Description: The DHARMa package uses a simulation-based approach to create
    readily interpretable scaled residuals from fitted generalized linear mixed
    models. Currently supported are 'lme4', 'glm' (except quasi-distributions) and 'lm' model 
    classes. The resulting residuals are standardized to values between 0 and 1 and 
    can be interpreted as intuitively as residuals from a linear regression. The package 
    also provides a number of plot and test functions for typical model misspecification
    problem, such as over/underdispersion, zero-inflation, and spatial and temporal
    autocorrelation.
