Title: Residual Diagnostics for HierArchical (Multi-level / Mixed) Regression Models
Version: 0.0.3.0
Date: 12.8.2016
Authors@R: c(person("Florian", "Hartig", email = "florian.hartig@biologie.uni-regensburg.de", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: The package creates easily interpretable residuals for generalized
    linear mixed models that are standardized to values between 0 and 1. This is
    achieved by a simulation-based approach, similar to the Bayesian p-value or the
    parametric bootstrap: 1) simulate new data from the fitted model 2) calculate
    the cummulative empirical density function 3) residual is the value of the
    empirical density function at the value of the observed data.
