NOTE: for more news about the package, see https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/releases


DHARMa 0.2.0 (in preparation)

Major changes

- includes support for model class 'lme' from package 'nlme', however, without the option to re-simulate random effects, and 'gam' from 'mgcv'

- Technical note: compatibility with nlme is created by implementing / overwriting missing generic functions such as family() or model.frame(), so that the existing simulateResiduals function could be used more or less unchanged. For the moment, this seems to be the strategy to include further model classes. 

Minor changes

- plotResiduals includes support for factors 

- updates to the help 

DHARMa 0.1.2

- This bugfix release fixes an issue with backwards compatibility introduced in the 0.1.1 release, which used the 'startsWith' function that is only available in R base since 3.3.0. In 0.1.2, all occurences of 'startsWith' were replaced with 'grepl', which restores the compatibility with older R versions.

DHARMa 0.1.1

- including now the negative binomial models from MASS and lme4, as well as the possibility to create synthetic data from the negative binomial family

- includes a createDHARMa function that allows using the plot functions of DHARMa also with externally created simualtions, for example for Bayesian predictive simulations

DHARMA 0.1

- initial release, with support for lm, glm, lme4
