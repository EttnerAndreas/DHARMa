Idea: for testing RSA in GLMs or similar, it is common to perform autocorrelation tests (Moran's I or similar) on raw or transformed (deviance) residuals. One would expect that this could create a problem due to the assymetry of these residuals for small / large counts for the binomial, and small counts for the Poisson. This document tests if such problems occcur. 


```{r}
library(ape)
library(RandomFields)
library(fields)

```





```{r}
ape::Moran.I()
```








```{r}
model <- RMexp()
x <- seq(0, 10, length.out = 10)
z <- RFsimulate(model, x, x, n=1)
image.plot(matrix(z@data$variable1, nrow = length(x)))

data = cbind(coordinates(z), z@data$variable1)
```
